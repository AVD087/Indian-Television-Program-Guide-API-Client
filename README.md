Incase you are using the API in anyway, just mail me at garg.chand06@gmail.com and I will mention it over here.


### How to Use the API?

One can enter a channel name from the list and the date in the format ddmmyyyy to get the program guide data of that particular day as a key-value mapped JSON file. Make sure the person using this, enter a valid date for which data is available. Other than the time and  the name of the show, result file also lists various other details about the show ï¿½ like description, genre, lanuage, cast, director, etc.

### Requirements

Java Client uses GSON java library(included in lib folder) to parse the JSON response.


### Disclaimer

The program guide data is made available by parsing content from websites. Using this may violate copyright laws/terms & conditions of the websites.
